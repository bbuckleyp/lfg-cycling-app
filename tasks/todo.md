# Todo List - Make Ride Cards Smaller

## Tasks

- [x] Analyze current RideCard component size and layout
- [x] Create more compact RideCard layout by reducing padding and spacing
- [x] Reduce route preview map height from 200px to smaller size
- [x] Optimize text sizes and spacing in card sections
- [x] Test the changes to ensure multiple cards are visible on screen

## Analysis

Current RideCard component has several areas that make it large:
- Large padding (p-4) 
- Route preview map is min-h-[200px]
- Generous spacing between sections (mb-3, mb-4)
- Large text sizes and spacing

## Plan

1. Reduce overall card padding from p-4 to p-3
2. Decrease route preview height from 200px to 120px
3. Reduce margins between sections
4. Optimize text sizes and spacing
5. Test to ensure readability is maintained while showing more cards

## Review

### Changes Made

1. **Reduced card padding**: Changed from `p-4` to `p-3` for more compact layout
2. **Decreased margins**: Reduced section margins from `mb-3` to `mb-2` and gaps from `gap-3` to `gap-2`
3. **Smaller route preview**: Reduced map height from `min-h-[200px]` to `min-h-[120px]`
4. **Optimized text sizes**: Changed title from `text-lg sm:text-xl` to `text-base sm:text-lg`
5. **Reduced route section padding**: Changed from `p-3` to `p-2`
6. **Tightened spacing**: Reduced `space-y-3` to `space-y-2` in action areas
7. **Reduced grid gap**: Changed rides grid from `gap-8` to `gap-4`

### Result

The ride cards are now significantly more compact while maintaining readability. Users should now be able to see multiple ride cards on the screen without needing to scroll, improving the browsing experience.
