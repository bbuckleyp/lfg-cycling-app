## Security Findings Summary

### CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. **JWT Secret Configuration Vulnerability** (HIGH RISK)
**File**: `/Users/bbuckley/Projects/lfg-cycling-app/backend/src/utils/jwt.ts`
**Issue**: Fallback to weak secret key
```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'fallback-secret-key';
```
**Risk**: If JWT_SECRET environment variable is not set, the application falls back to a hardcoded, easily guessable secret. This could allow attackers to forge JWT tokens.
**Recommendation**: Remove fallback and fail fast if JWT_SECRET is not configured. Add stronger validation.

#### 2. **External Script Loading from Third-Party Domain** (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)
**Files**: 
- `/Users/bbuckley/Projects/lfg-cycling-app/frontend/src/components/StravaEmbed.tsx`
- `/Users/bbuckley/Projects/lfg-cycling-app/frontend/src/components/StravaRoutePreview.tsx`
**Issue**: Dynamic loading of external JavaScript from `https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js`
**Risk**: 
- Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass
- Third-party script could be compromised
- No integrity checking (SRI)
**Recommendation**: 
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes
- Consider hosting the script locally or using iframe sandboxing

#### 3. **DOM Manipulation with innerHTML** (MEDIUM RISK)
**Files**: Same as above
**Issue**: Direct DOM manipulation using `innerHTML` without sanitization
**Risk**: Potential XSS if Strava embed content is compromised
**Recommendation**: Use safer DOM manipulation methods or sanitize content

### MEDIUM ISSUES

#### 4. **Missing Rate Limiting**
**Files**: All API routes
**Issue**: No rate limiting implemented on API endpoints
**Risk**: Brute force attacks, DoS attacks
**Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting middleware

#### 5. **Inconsistent User ID Field Usage**
**Files**: Multiple (auth types, notification routes)
**Issue**: JWT payload contains both `id` and `userId` fields, causing confusion
**Risk**: Authorization bypass if wrong field is used
**Recommendation**: Standardize on single user ID field

#### 6. **Error Information Disclosure**
**Files**: Multiple route files
**Issue**: Generic error handling may leak sensitive information
**Risk**: Information disclosure
**Recommendation**: Implement structured error handling with safe error messages

### LOW ISSUES

#### 7. **Missing Input Sanitization for Display**
**Issue**: User-generated content (comments, descriptions) not sanitized for display
**Risk**: Stored XSS if React's built-in protection fails
**Recommendation**: Additional sanitization layer for user content

## POSITIVE SECURITY PRACTICES IDENTIFIED

### ✅ Strong Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication properly implemented
- Authorization checks in place for all protected routes
- User can only modify their own data (events, comments, RSVPs)
- Proper organizer-only access control for event management

### ✅ Input Validation
- Comprehensive Zod schemas for all user inputs
- Server-side validation on all endpoints
- Type-safe database queries using Prisma ORM
- Proper parameter validation (event IDs, comment IDs, etc.)

### ✅ SQL Injection Protection
- All database queries use Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- No raw SQL queries found
- Type-safe database operations

### ✅ Data Access Control
- Users can only access notifications intended for them
- Event organizers can only modify their own events
- Comment authors can only modify their own comments
- RSVP operations properly scoped to authenticated user

### ✅ Password Security
- Passwords properly hashed using bcrypt
- No password storage in plaintext
- JWT tokens have expiration

### ✅ Frontend Security
- React's built-in XSS protection active
- No use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML found
- Proper token handling with automatic removal on 401

## RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY

### IMMEDIATE (Critical)
1. **Fix JWT Secret Handling**: Remove fallback secret, add environment validation
2. **Add Content Security Policy**: Implement CSP to control external script loading
3. **Add SRI for External Scripts**: Implement Subresource Integrity for Strava embeds

### SHORT TERM (High Priority)
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **Standardize User ID Fields**: Choose either `id` or `userId` consistently
6. **Add Input Sanitization**: Additional sanitization for user-generated content

### MEDIUM TERM (Medium Priority)
7. **Enhance Error Handling**: Implement structured, safe error responses
8. **Add Security Headers**: Implement helmet.js for additional security headers
9. **Add Request Logging**: Implement comprehensive request logging for security monitoring

### LONG TERM (Nice to Have)
10. **Add HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all production traffic uses HTTPS
11. **Implement Session Management**: Consider moving to session-based auth for better security
12. **Add API Versioning**: Implement proper API versioning for future security updates

## OVERALL SECURITY ASSESSMENT

**Grade: B+**

The application demonstrates solid security fundamentals with proper authentication, authorization, and input validation. The use of Prisma ORM effectively prevents SQL injection, and the authorization patterns are well-implemented. However, the JWT secret fallback and external script loading present notable security risks that should be addressed immediately.

The architecture follows security best practices in most areas, with clear separation of concerns and proper access controls. The main areas for improvement are around configuration security and external dependency management.
